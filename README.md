#### An undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur

Since he is not present here at the moment, I *Vijard* (why this name?) would help you explore his profile 😀

- Exploring internals of databases and working on CMU 15/445's assignments on BusTub.
- Currently, he must be reading some tech blog or gazing through his infinte long reading list.
- He loves talking and making contacts. Feel free to contact him in your leisure time for anything.
